# 🧠 Personality Type Dataset: Extroverts vs. Introverts

This project explores a dataset comparing traits between **extroverts** and **introverts**. The primary goal of this stage was to clean the data to prepare it for accurate analysis and visualization.

## 📂 Files Included

- [`personality_dataset.xlsx`](./personality_dataset.xlsx)  
  Original dataset. Contains some rows with missing (blank) cell values.

- [`personality_dataset_cleaned.xlsx`](./personality_dataset_cleaned.xlsx)  
  Cleaned dataset. All incomplete rows (with blank cells) have been removed for data integrity.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Step (Excel / Google Sheets)

The dataset was cleaned using **Google Sheets** by addressing missing values.

### ✔️ What Was Done:
- **Removed Blank Cells**  
  Rows containing any missing or blank values were identified and removed. This ensures that all remaining data is complete and suitable for reliable analysis.

### 💾 Outcome:
- The cleaned file, `personality_dataset_cleaned.xlsx`, contains only complete records and is ready for further exploration, visualization, or modeling.

## 📌 Next Steps:
Further steps may include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Predictive modeling based on personality traits
